# Quest-2--Shark-Defence

"Shark Defense"

Business case:
We are a startup called "Shark Defense". We developed a highly innovative protective gear against shark attacks.
This gear prevents any kind of injury but its main strength is preventing fatal outcomes.

Problem statement: 
In order to enter the market the broadest market of potential customers we need to find the countries most affected by shark attacks in general and particularly for fatal outcomes.

Scope:
We decided to go with the top 5 countries for each category and to focus our analysis on finding the most affected countries to set up shop.

Hypotheses:
1. Shark attacks occur more in countries of the global South
2. The higher the crime rate of the country the higher the fatal incidences
3. The number of shark attacks has generally increased in the last decade (as more and more people get into water sports)
